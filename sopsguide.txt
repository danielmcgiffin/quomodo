I have set up sops to securely sync your .env.local file. Here is what
  was done:


   1. Configured `sops`: Created a .sops.yaml file using your age public
      key (age1u8v...).
   2. Encrypted Secrets: Generated .env.local.sops, an encrypted version
      of your environment variables that is safe to commit to Git.
   3. Updated Git: Modified .gitignore to allow tracking .env.local.sops
      while continuing to ignore the plain-text .env.local.
   4. Added Scripts: Added npm run secrets:encrypt and npm run
      secrets:decrypt to your package.json for easy syncing.


  To use this on your other host machine:
   1. Ensure sops is installed on that machine.
   2. Copy your age secret key to ~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt on the new
      host (since it was derived from your SSH key, you might already
      have it or can re-derive it).
   3. Run npm run secrets:decrypt to create the local .env.local file.
